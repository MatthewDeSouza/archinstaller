# archinstaller
Simple arch installation script. Some parts (like the drive partitioning) aren't the prettiest but I believe it allows for easier readability.


Please check over all functions in 'functions.sh', for some are hardcoded specifically for my needs.

Script allows for some customization during its execution.

Enjoy and fork!!
